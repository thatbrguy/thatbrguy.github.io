I am currently pursuing the MS in Robotics (MSR) program at Carnegie Mellon University. Previously, I worked at Siemens Digital Industries Software as part of the Intelligent Control Systems (ICS) team where I built models, algorithms and systems for myriad autonomous driving and general machine learning applications.

I am generally interested in various problems related to perception and machine learning. Of late, I am specifically interested in researching about how to best structure learning-based methods with traditional algorithms and theory from geometry and physics to create perception systems that can better handle the challenges of complex real world scenarios.

I am always on the lookout for opportunities to learn more and work on exciting projects in the fields of my interest.
