Humans are able to create complex mental representations of real-world scenes from just a brief glance. Even though such scenes contain several objects at various locations, each having diverse material characteristics and being illuminated by arbitrary light sources, we are able to implicitly reason about these **properties** and utilize them to plan and navigate.

I am interested in creating algorithms that can reason about scenes as effective as humans do. To this end, I am excited to research (neural) representations and techniques that can effectively leverage priors from large foundational models to infer properties of real-world scenes from casually captured images and videos.

Prior to joining CMU, I spent 3 incredible years at Siemens Digital Industries Software as part of the Intelligent Control Systems (ICS) team where I built models, algorithms and systems for myriad autonomous driving and general machine learning applications. Please checkout my [resume](assets/pdf/Bharath_Raj_Nagoor_Kani_Resume.pdf) for additional information about my work.

I am currently on the lookout for **PhD oppurtunities** starting **Fall 2024**! Please reach out if you think I would be a good fit for your lab.
