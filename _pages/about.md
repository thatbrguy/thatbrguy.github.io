I am interested in creating algorithms that can reason about scenes with the same proficiency as humans. 

Everyday scenes consist of multiple objects positioned in diverse spatial arrangements, with each object presenting distinct physical properties, including dynamics, appearance and structure. Humans are able to implicitly create complex mental representations of these properties from just a brief glance, enabling them to plan and interact with the environment.

I am excited to research representations and techniques that can effectively leverage priors from large foundation models to infer physical properties of scenes from limited observations of casually captured images and videos towards enabling great applications in robotics and graphics.

Prior to joining CMU, I spent 3 incredible years at Siemens Digital Industries Software as part of the Intelligent Control Systems (ICS) team where I built models, algorithms and systems for myriad autonomous driving and general machine learning applications. Please checkout my [resume](assets/pdf/Bharath_Raj_Nagoor_Kani_Resume.pdf) for additional information about my work.

I am currently on the lookout for **Summer Internship Opportunities** starting **May 2024**! Please reach out if you think I would be a good fit for your team.
